# Project Requirements
This document outlines the requirements and guidelines for the machine learning project. The project encompasses the entire machine learning workflow, including data acquisition, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and discussion on deployment. The project deliverables include a series of presentations and well-documented Python code capturing the analysis.

## Deliverables
1. Project Idea Pitch Slides: A brief presentation to introduce the project idea, aiming for feedback.
2. Project Presentation Slides: Detailed slides for in-class presentation, covering the project's findings and insights.
3. Python Code: The analysis code, complete with comments, interpretations, and results.
## Project Workflow
### Data Acquisition
- Sources: Real data, Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Microsoft Azure, data.gv.at, etc.
- Requirements: At least 1000 instances, ~10 features, mixed feature types, suitable for classification/regression.
### Data Exploration and Cleaning
- In-depth exploration with numeric summaries and visualizations (scatter plots, density plots, etc.).
- Quality visualizations are crucial and will influence grading.
### Data Preprocessing
- Attempt at least one preprocessing step (e.g., dimensionality reduction, scaling, encoding).
- The aim is to explore preprocessing options and select the best for the final model.
### Model Building
- Performance assessment and hyperparameter tuning are essential.
- Consider computational resources and possibly use a sample for initial stages but train the final model on the entire dataset.
### Interpretation & Critical Discussion
- Discuss model deployment from technical and societal viewpoints.
- Address potential biases in the dataset and their implications.
## Presentations
### Project Idea Pitch
- 4 slides, 4 minutes: Dataset, features and targets, hypothesis, preliminary schedule, and work distribution.
### Project Presentation
- 10 minutes plus discussion: Focus on visualizing findings and ensuring the presentation can stand alone without live code demonstrations.
### Code Documentation
- Python3 Script (.py): Organize code to be readable and structured, documenting the analysis workflow step-by-step.
- Anaconda environment .yaml file: Ensure project reproducibility.
### Schedule
- Project Idea Pitch: Upload by class 5 and present during the in-class session.
- Project Presentation: Upload slides by class 14 for group presentations during classes 14/15.
- Code Upload: Submit final Python code by the end of the course, incorporating feedback received.
